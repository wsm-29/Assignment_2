{\parbox{4.8in}{\footnotesize Notes: This table presents Poisson regression models estimating the causal effect of anti-vaping laws on the number of lung-related hospitalizations, controlling for state and year fixed effects. Model 1 examines year-by-year differences in lung hospitalizations between treated states and control states during the pre-treatment period (before 2021) to assess parallel trends requirement. Year 2010 is the reference year. Model 2 estimates the impact of anti-vaping laws by including an interaction term between a post-2021 dummy variable (indicating years after 2020) and a treatment indicator for states that implemented anti-vaping laws in 2021. The coefficient in Model 2 indicates that on average, states with an anti-vaping law experienced a 3.6\% decline in the number of lung-related hospitalizations following the law's implementation.\\Standard errors are in parentheses. \sym{*} \(p<0.05\), \sym{**} \(p<0.01\), \sym{***} \(p<0.001\)
